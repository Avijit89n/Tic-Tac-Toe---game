## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Game status updates in real-time (whose turn it is, who wins, or if itâ€™s a draw)
- Reset the game to play again

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structuring the game layout
- CSS for styling and design
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
- IDE/Editor: Visual Studio Code

## How to play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to click on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
4. By default, first player assigned the mark 'X' and second player assigned 'O'.
3. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.
5. Use the 'Reset Now/New Game' button to clear the board and start a new game.
